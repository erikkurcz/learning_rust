# Learning Rust Repo :crab:

This repo is just to learn a bit of rust through some examples of the fundamentals. 

Ideally the following will be covered:

* Command line parsing
* Basic math
* Control Flow
* Structures: array, vector, hashmap, custom structs
* Memory management
* Ownership
* General standard library functions, maybe some shm work
